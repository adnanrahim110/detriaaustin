    text: "I didn’t expect a book about service to feel this personal. It’s not preachy and it doesn’t talk in circles. It just shows, in a very real way, how the smallest choices—checking in, listening properly, following through—can change how people feel and how teams function. I kept thinking, ‘Yes… this is what leadership is supposed to look like.",

    text: "What I liked most is that it doesn’t act like service is some big, dramatic thing. It’s the everyday stuff—being consistent, keeping your word, making space for people. The stories feel honest, and the lessons don’t feel forced. I finished it feeling challenged, but in a good way—like I could actually do something with what I read.",

There were parts that made me pause and reflect, and parts that made me want to text someone and say, ‘Read this—this is how you lead without losing your humanity.",
